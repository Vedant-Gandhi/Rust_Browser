# Rust_Browser
This is just a simple effort to create an browser using Rust language which has a GUI and can parse HTML and CSS files easily. 

# Development is still in progress 😄😄😄😄😄😄😄

This project aims to demonstrate how a web browser parses HTML files to create a DOM and applies CSS to it.It is not as fast as the browsers used for everyday work but it is just a test sample.The code is easily readable so anyone who understands rust can easily read this code and also develop it by himself/herself.

I will soon update the readme accordingly as the updates happen

## Files
1 DOM.RS-This files hold the elements which are useful generation of DOM .It provides various non primitive datatypes as well as methods used for handling of the DOM

2.HTMLParser.RS-This file is the html parse engine that will be used by the browser to create DOM.It can parse most the elements such as text.Comments and Data Elements.


# Currently only this is what I have developed.Will update as soon as possible 👍
